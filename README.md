# Material-design-by-Python-and-Thermo-Calc
Design of a heat treatment for steel utilizing the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) approach of material design.

The genetic approach, which has been briefly introduced during the lecture, with its minimization of human impact on the design, shows a different mentality compared to the engineers focus in Olsonâ€™s work. In this project a genetic algorithm will be applied to a materials design problematic.

The heat treatment of a commercial alloy, from Sandvik Materials Technology and manufactured by hot working, will be designed with respect to the optimization of its martensite volume fraction and carbides precipitates volume fraction.

To do so, an integrated scheme will be implemented through the TC-Python interface to couple Thermo-Calc calculations, like property calculator types and TC-Prisma, the precipitation module from Thermo-Calc. This program aiming at predicting the microstructure evolution during the process will then be coupled with an existing genetic algorithm.

In this project the students should get familiar with the genetic approach, get insight in programming and designing modelling integrated platforms, and establish the best set of design parameters for optimizing the material by running simulations.
